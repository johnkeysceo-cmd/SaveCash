# Pre-Launch Legal Framework Risk Assessment

## Quick Answer: Risk Rating Scale (1-10)

### **Minimal Legal Docs (4k-10k words) - Risk: 6/10** ⚠️

**What you'd have:**
- Basic Terms of Service (~3k words)
- Basic Privacy Policy (~3k words)
- Simple Cookie Policy (~1k words)
- Basic Disclaimer (~1k words)

**Risks:**
- ❌ **No IP protections** - competitors can copy without legal recourse
- ❌ **No anti-scraping clauses** - data can be harvested
- ❌ **No beta confidentiality** - early users can leak features
- ❌ **Limited liability shields** - more exposure to lawsuits
- ❌ **Weak partner protections** - hard to enforce exclusivity
- ❌ **No enforcement mechanisms** - harder to stop violations
- ⚠️ **Investor concerns** - VCs expect enterprise-grade legal
- ⚠️ **Regulatory gaps** - may miss fintech compliance requirements

**Verdict:** Functional but **vulnerable**. You can launch, but you're exposed.

- Comprehensive Terms with IP/anti-competition (~8k words)

## Recommendation for Pre-Launch

### **Layer 1 (Minimum MUST-HAVE - 10k words): 7/10 risk**

If you absolutely can't invest time, get these 4 core docs:

1. **Terms of Service** (~4k words) - WITH anti-scraping clause
2. **Privacy Policy** (~4k words) - GDPR/CCPA compliant
3. **Cookie Policy** (~1k words)
4. **Basic Disclaimer** (~1k words)

**Time investment:** 2-3 days with templates

**Still missing:**
- No beta confidentiality → risky for early users
- No IP enforcement → competitors can copy
- No partner protections → hard to lock exclusivity

### **Layer 2 (Recommended - 25k words): 4/10 risk**

Add these on top of Layer 1:

5. **Beta Confidentiality Terms** (~2k words)

9. **EULA** (~2k words)
10. **Basic Compliance Pages** (~9k words total)
