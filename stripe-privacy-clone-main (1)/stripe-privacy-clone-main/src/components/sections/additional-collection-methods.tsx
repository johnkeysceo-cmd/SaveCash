          Analyzing and drawing inferences from Transaction Data to reduce costs, fraud, and disputes and increase authentication and authorization rates for SaveCash and our Business Users.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong className="font-medium">Communications.</strong> We use the contact information we have about you to deliver our Services, <a href="https://SaveCash.com/legal/privacy-center#communicating-with-you" className="text-primary hover:text-foreground hover:underline">Learn More</a>, which may involve sending codes via SMS for your authentication. <a href="https://SaveCash.com/docs/sms-autofill" className="text-primary hover:text-foreground hover:underline">Learn More</a>.

      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong className="font-medium">Fraud Prevention and Security.</strong> We collect and use Personal Data to help us identify and manage activities that could be fraudulent or harmful across our Services, enable our fraud detection Business Services, and secure our Services and transactions against unauthorized access, use, alteration or misappropriation of Personal Data, information, and funds. As part of the fraud prevention, detection, security monitoring, and compliance efforts for SaveCash and its Business Users, we collect information from publicly available sources, third parties (such as credit bureaus), and via the Services we offer. In some instances, we may also collect information about you directly from you, or from our Business Users, Financial Partners, and other third parties for the same purposes.

Any other entity that buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your Personal Data, subject to the terms of this Policy.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong className="font-medium">Compliance and Harm Prevention.</strong> We share Personal Data when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable law; to abide by rules imposed by Financial Partners in connection with the use of their payment method; to enforce our contractual rights; to secure and protect the Services, rights, privacy, safety, and property of SaveCash, you, and others, including against malicious or fraudulent activity; and to respond to valid legal requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include authorities outside your country of residence.
