The "50/30/20 rule" (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings) is helpful as a starting point, but it fails to account for the unique financial situations, goals, and spending patterns of individual users. What works for a recent college graduate in San Francisco won't work for a family of four in Kansas, or a retiree in Florida.              </p>              <p className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed">                Traditional tools also require significant manual effort. Users must categorize every transaction, set budgets for dozens of categories, and constantly monitor their spending. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and often leads to abandonment. Studies show that over 80% of users stop using budgeting apps within the first three months, primarily due to the manual work required.              </p>              <p className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed">                Additionally, generic advice doesn't adapt to changing circumstances. Life events like job changes, moving, having children, or unexpected expenses require complete budget overhauls. Most tools don't proactively suggest adjustments or identify new savings opportunities as your situation evolves.              </p>            </section>            <section className="space-y-4">              <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-text-primary)] mt-12 mb-6">How AI-Powered Recommendations Work</h2>              <p className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed">                Our AI-powered savings recommendation system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze your financial behavior and provide personalized, actionable insights.

Pattern Recognition and Analysis</h3>              <p className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed">                The system analyzes thousands of data points from your transaction history, including:              </p>              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed">                <li><strong>Spending patterns:</strong> Time of day, day of week, and seasonal variations in your spending</li>                <li><strong>Merchant analysis:</strong> Which merchants you frequent and how much you spend at each</li>                <li><strong>Category trends:</strong> How your spending in different categories changes over time</li>                <li><strong>Income patterns:</strong> When you receive income and how it relates to your spending</li>                <li><strong>Recurring transactions:</strong> Subscriptions, bills, and other regular expenses</li>                <li><strong>Anomalies:</strong> Unusual spending spikes or drops that might indicate opportunities</li>              </ul>              <p className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed mt-4">                Unlike simple rule-based systems, our AI identifies complex patterns that humans might miss. For example, it might notice that you spend 40% more on groceries during the first week of each month, or that your coffee purchases increase by 60% during stressful work periods.              </p>              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-text-primary)] mt-8 mb-4">2. Machine Learning Models</h3>              <p className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed">                We use several advanced machine learning models, each optimized for different aspects of financial analysis:              </p>              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed">                <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> Deep learning models that identify non-linear patterns in spending behavior</li>                <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Models that predict future spending based on historical patterns</li>                <li><strong>Clustering Algorithms:</strong> Group similar users to identify best practices and opportunities</li>                <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Identify unusual spending that might indicate waste or opportunities</li>                <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Similar to Netflix or Amazon, suggest specific actions based on your profile</li>              </ul>              <p className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)] leading-relaxed mt-4">                These models are trained on anonymized data from millions of users while maintaining strict privacy protections. They continuously learn and improve, becoming more accurate over time as they process more data and receive feedback.              </p>              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-text-primary)] mt-8 mb-4">3.
